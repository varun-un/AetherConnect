                Often times, there's a disconnect between students and more advanced topics they may be learning in math and science. Many
                of these topics and concepts may be difficult to understand from simple slideshows or descriptions, which they are often 
                taught through. Then there is also the problem of accessibility, as many advanced science topics, especially those at a 
                collegiate level, are not easily accessible to many. 
                <br /><br />
                Aether Connect is a website meant to bridge the gap between learners and the science and math that exists out there. Here,
                you can find 3D simulations of different aspects of science, concepts which are difficult to understand and visualize without
                hands-on, 3D experience.
